The Alexa Service, is a micro-service that allows [Octoblu](https://www.octoblu.com) to react and respond to requests from the [Amazon Echo](https://echo.amazon.com) device, or an Alexa App.

Octoblu hosts an instance of the Alexa Service at [alexa.octoblu.com](https://alexa.octoblu.com) and is available for public use.

# Creating a Custom Skill

- Create Amazon Developer Account
- See the [Getting Started Guide](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/getting-started-guide) by Amazon
- Add a new skill on the [skill list](https://developer.amazon.com/edw/home.html#/skills/list) page.
- **Skill Information**
  - Select "Custom Interaction Model"
  - Set your Skill Name
  - Set the Invocation Name
- **Interaction Model**
  - Set the Intent Schema to:
```json
{
  "intents": [
    {
      "intent": "Trigger",
      "slots": [
        {
          "name": "Name",
          "type": "TRIGGER"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "intent": "ListTriggers"
    },
    {
      "intent": "AMAZON.HelpIntent"
    },
    {
      "intent": "AMAZON.StopIntent"
    },
    {
      "intent": "AMAZON.CancelIntent"
    }
  ]
}
```
  - Create a Custom Slot with a type of "TRIGGER" and the values will be the name of the tasks you want to run. The values should be the same of the "echo-in" node name in your flow.
  - Add the following generic Sample Utterances
```json
{
  "intents": [
    {
      "name": "AMAZON.CancelIntent",
      "samples": []
    },
    {

## Custom Flows
1. Import the base [Alexa Flow](https://app.octoblu.com/bluprints/import/9a6b516c-5f55-4676-bbf5-657612fb35e7)
1. An "Echo In" node in the [Octoblu Designer](https://app.octoblu.com) receives input into a flow from the Alexa Service. The name of the "Echo In" node should match a value in the Trigger custom slot configuration. When a Alexa Request is received, you will get a callbackUrl in the message and other information about the request.
1. An "Echo Out" allows you to respond to the Alexa request. You will need to use the callbackUrl from "Echo In" node. The value should be `{{msg.callbackUrl}}`.
  - You can optionally set the response text.
  - The latest version allows you to respond to an echo-out node with a "response" object. The response object will be passed along to the Alexa response. This gives you full access to the Alexa response object.
1. For every echo-in request, a response needs to be sent through the echo-out node.
1. The flow must be deployed and online.
